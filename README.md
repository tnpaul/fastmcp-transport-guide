## Why this repo?

I created this to document what I learned while experimenting with MCP servers and clients.  
Over time, this will grow into a reference hub with:

- Transport option comparisons  
- Tool calling examples  
- Claude Desktop integration notes  
- Debugging common MCP errors  

If you're also learning MCP, feel free to star ‚≠ê this repo and follow along!
